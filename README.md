### zsh

use the files ```work``` or ```home``` files to customize zsh shell based on where you are using it e.g at work or at home etc.

Make sure that change you perform on these files shouldn't be committed to the repository because these are supposed to have work/ personal sensitive information. Tell git to ignore any changes done to these files by
running -

``` sh
$ git git update-index --skip-worktree zsh/.prv
```

or you can also run ```git update-index --assume-unchanged zsh/.prv/*``` and ```git update-index --no-assume-unchanged zsh/.prv/*``` to undo the previous command and start tracking the changes to these files again.
