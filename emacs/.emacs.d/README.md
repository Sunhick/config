## Major Refactor

* Migrate away from ```org-mode``` and ```babel``` files. Run time compilation for very little readability gain.
* Gives me a change to finally use my Emacs lisp skills.
* How to organize emacs config files purely using elisp. Existing work research.
* A overhaul of my emacs configurations, entirely written in emacs lisp that uses ```use-package``` with auto-install(```:ensure```) and defered loading of packages(```:defer```).
* Turn this package into a zero-configuration package. Anyone who want to use this should fork or ```git clone``` this and be able to use it.
* Get rid of MacOS dependencies.
* Should also support curl install script.
